This script uses the program *sox* (sound exchange)
L<http://sox.sourceforge.net/> to play sounds in your
earphones. Please verify that you have it installed in your system.

Afterwards:

Install the package automatically using

$ cpanm App::tonematch

Otherwise you can download the package and unpack it to any directory,
change to it and give the commands:

  $ perl Build.PL
  $ ./Build
  $ ./Build test
  $ ./Build install

Alternatively you may try

  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ make test
  $ make install
